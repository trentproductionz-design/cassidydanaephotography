  "featured_p1": "Photography chose me long before I chose it. Growing up in Michigan, I was the kid always carrying a disposable camera, documenting everything from family dinners to the changing seasons along Lake Michigan. But it wasn't until I photographed my first wedding that I understood what I was really meant to capture: not just images, but the feeling of a moment.",
  "featured_p2": "Today, my work takes me from the volcanic cliffs of Santorini to intimate barn ceremonies in the Midwest. Each destination brings its own challenges and magic, but the core of what I do remains unchanged. I'm there to document the authentic moments-the nervous laughter before walking down the aisle, the way your partner looks at you when they think no one's watching, the tears your father tries to hide during his speech.",
  "featured_p3": "The couples I work with aren't looking for posed perfection. They want their real story told. They want to remember how it felt, not just how it looked. That's why I approach each wedding as a journalist would approach a story-observing, anticipating, being present but never intrusive. My camera becomes invisible, and what remains is pure, unfiltered emotion.",

  "about_p2": "When I'm not photographing love stories around the world, you'll find me obsessed with a good grilled cheese, wrapped in cozy blankets with Ben & Jerry's, binging The Office for the hundredth time, or planning my next travel adventure with my fur-babes: Stella, Beau, Hammy, and Rosie.",
  "about_highlight": "But mostly? I'm here to capture the real, unscripted moments-the ones you'll want to remember forever. The belly laughs, the happy tears, the way your partner looks at you when they think no one's watching. Those are the moments that matter.",
  "about_p3": "My approach is simple: I treat your wedding day like the important piece of history it is. I'm part photojournalist, part hype person, and entirely devoted to making sure you feel comfortable, supported, and completely yourself from start to finish.",

We were so wrapped up in the day that we forgot she was even there-and then we got our photos back and realized she'd captured every single moment we didn't want to miss. The images are stunning, but more than that, they feel like us. Real, honest, and full of joy."

From our first call to the moment we received our gallery, she was supportive, encouraging, and so much fun to be around. She understood our vision completely and delivered images that exceeded every expectation. If you're considering her for your wedding-stop considering and just book her. You won't regret it."
